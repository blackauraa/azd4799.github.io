  <h2>Arizona: One of the Best States in the US</h2>
  <p>
    Arizona is a very diverse state, which adds to many great features to
    the state. There is a wide variety of different types of geography which
    makes each city and town interesting. Arizona is known as the Grand
    Canyon State due to the beautiful nature and features up north. There
    are three specific cities that are very special that will be introduced
    here. As an Arizona Native, I have been to all three of these wonderful
    cities and there are many great features about them.
